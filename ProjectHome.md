A simplified chat bot, designed for connection to Battle.net using BNLS encoding.

**NOTE: SOME VERSIONS WILL REQUIRE YOU TO OPEN 'Config' and just Save/Accept it. This updates the config.ini file and resolves MANY issues. I will add error handlers for that later to avoid runtime errors.**

For anyone that wants to actually play with the source. I've uploaded 'Stable' under Trunk, which is the latest stable version. And then under Branches I uploaded 'Current' which is the current incarnation. That version MAY NOT WORK all of the time, as its a nightly build.
